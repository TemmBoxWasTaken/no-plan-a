        <p>Welcome to <b>No Plan A</b>! </p>
        
        <p>No Plan A is a website dedicated to providing an alternitive to other browser gaming sites, in case they get blocked. This website was made by a 9th grader, so hopefully the schools are nice and let me live.</p>
        
        <p>Games are not currently available at the moment, so please wait a week or two for me to figure out how to code this stuff in.</p>
